# MLOps Framework

Now that we have a solid understanding of MLOps, let's dive into its key components. We'll explore how MLOps frameworks can help streamline and optimize the development, deployment, and maintenance of machine learning models.

## Key Components of MLOps

1. **Data Management**: Effective handling of data used for training and inference, ensuring quality, consistency, and compliance with privacy standards.
2. **Model Development and Training**: Techniques and processes for developing and training models, incorporating best practices to optimize performance and accuracy.
3. **Model Deployment**: Strategies for deploying models into production environments, considering storage, availability, and versioning.
4. **Model Monitoring and Maintenance**: Continuous monitoring to ensure models maintain their performance and accuracy over time, adapting to new data and evolving conditions.
5. **Collaboration and Automation**: Leveraging tools and practices for automating workflows and facilitating collaboration among team members.

## MLOps Frameworks

Within the broader scope of MLOps, model management specifically addresses the life cycle and governance of machine learning models. This includes:

1. **Version Control**: Robust mechanisms to manage different versions of models and their corresponding data and parameters.
2. **Continuous Evaluation**: Processes to assess model performance in real-world scenarios and ensure they meet required standards.
3. **Retraining and Updating**: Efficient strategies for retraining and updating models in response to new data or changing environments, ensuring they remain relevant and effective.

## MLOps Frameworks vs. Traditional ML

MLOps frameworks provide a comprehensive suite of tools and capabilities to automate and manage the machine learning lifecycle. They address problems such as:

1. **Experiment Tracking**: Keeping track of various experiments, including parameters, code versions, metrics, and artifacts.
2. **Model Versioning**: Managing different versions of models along with their dependencies.
3. **Package Management**: Simplifying packaging a model with all its dependencies to ensure consistent execution.

## Choosing an MLOps Framework**

There are many options available, each with unique strengths and focus areas. For this course, we will be using MLflow for several reasons:

1. **Open Source**: Freely available to everyone, making it accessible and easy to use.
2. **Agnostic**: Integrates with any machine learning library and environment, providing flexibility.
3. **Industry Adoption**: A popular framework with a robust community and continuous improvements.
